    As a team, what do we stand for? What do we strive to do, and how can we do this? These are the questions we must ask ourselves.
    
    We work to make our community better and to do this, we have to work together to do this.
    
    Podsmead Clearance Team aims to not just be better than our opposition, but to set a new standard. Not aim to the same standard.
    
    Everyone has their own role, from manager to team member, we are all important.
    
    Would you like to see more done with this app, if so then email the app developer with your ideas, no matter how small.
